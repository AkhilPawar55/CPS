Test Case : test1.txt
Description:	1.)This is a general test case. Aimed to test the chain reaction when the different
				paintball's are triggered, coloring cow's if within range of the paintball and 
				trigerring other paintball's if the other paintball's are within the reach of the 
				triggered paintball.
				2.)Also, to test if a vertex is created if there is no edge between colors
				and cows.
				3.)Tests if a paintball pops when it is on the edge of a circle(sheel on edge of PINK's circle
				    and PURPLE ON EDGE OF PINK)

Test Case : test2.txt
Description:	This test case simulates the condition where trigerring a paintball does not paint 
				a cow and does not trigger other paintball's in the field. Basically no chain 
				reaction.

Test Case : test3.txt
Description:	This test case simulates the condition where trigerring a paintball triggers 
				another paintball, which in turn triggers the trigerring paintball. Here the test
				case expects the already popped/triggered paintball to ignore the re-popping/
				re-trigerring event. Hence, not entering an infinite loop.
				Also, tests if same number of cows are painted by two different paintballs, 
				the paintball which was traversed first will be the optimal paintball.
